# Tic-Toc-Toe-cpp-game

My first ever game, first cpp game, using only cpp.
The game have 2 modes play with computer and multiplyer.<br/>
Any C++ compiler will run this code, i run it with gcc
but you can use visual studio if you want or any compiler in the web 
just copy the code and paste it and it will work :)
